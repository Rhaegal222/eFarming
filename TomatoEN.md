<p><b>Useful information on tomato cultivation</b></p>

<p>The tomato is a plant native to Peru, cultivated in Mexico first by the Maya and then by the Aztecs. In the last 200 years it has become one of the most important vegetable crops, many varieties have been selected to grow, adapting the plant to the most disparate climates and soils.</p>
<p>It is a vegetable that cannot be missing in any good home garden, so here we are to give you some tips on how to grow tomatoes. As always, we consider growing our vegetables in compliance with organic farming, i.e. without using synthetic chemical insecticides but with natural defense methods. The aim is to obtain healthy and sustainable vegetables, we will see how to do it below.</p>
<p>From the cherry tomato to the ox heart, from the classic sauce tomato to the extravagant black tomatoes, we are talking about a vegetable that never gets tired, thanks to its many varieties and the thousand uses it finds in the kitchen. The satisfaction of eating a tomato picked directly from your own plant will pay off all the agricultural work required, so let's see how to best cultivate this vegetable in an organic garden.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Il_terreno_e_il_clima_adatti_ai_pomodori">The right soil and climate for tomatoes
</span></b>
<p><strong>Ground.</strong>&nbsp;The ideal soil for growing tomatoes is with a ph = 6, the soil must be fairly loose and draining, free from stagnant water that would favor plant diseases. Furthermore, to obtain a good harvest, the soil must be rich in nutrients and organic matter. In fact, tomatoes are quite a greedy vegetable.</p>
<p><strong>Climate.</strong>. Even if enough cold-resistant types of tomato have been selected, it is still a plant that can stand the cold, and above all that requires excellent sun exposure. Tomatoes can be grown practically all over Italy, as long as you have a sun-kissed plot. The plant also fears excessive dryness, which can be limited by mulching and irrigation.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Concimazione_del_pomodoro">Fertilization of tomato</span></b>
<p>Fertilizing tomato is very important for a good harvest, especially if the soil has already been cultivated previously. The most important contribution of organic matter is the “basic fertilization”: it consists in putting the fertilizer in the preparatory working phase of the soil.</p>
<p>As a quantity we calculate 0.6 kg of pelleted organic fertilizer per square meter, 10 times as much if it is manure or mature <a title="Il compost" href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/terra-orto/compost.html">compost</a>. Given the choice, it is always better to use mature manure rather than pellets, since by adding more substance, the soil is fined, improving its structure. If the production is scalar, it is possible to intervene during the work with fertilization additions, also intervening with water-soluble organic products such as ox blood or borlande (residues from beet processing).</p>

<b><span id="EN_Come_si_seminano_i_pomodori">How tomatoes are sown</span></b>
<p><strong>Sow the tomato plants.</strong> The tomato should be sown in the seed tray, between February and March, the seed germinates in about a week. It must be placed in a warm environment: it takes about 24 degrees to germinate. It then requires at least 13 degrees to grow. The tomato is a plant that is sensitive to temperature rather than to the hours of light. You can learn more about the topic by reading the advice of Orto Da Coltivare on <a href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/coltivare/semina/pomodoro-semi.html">the sowing of tomatoes</a>.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Sesto_di_impianto">Spacing</span></b>
<p>To decide at what distance to transplant the tomato seedlings, you need to know if the plant has a specific habit (it stops growing when it reaches a certain size, so it does not require supports) or an indeterminate habit (supports must be prepared). Vegetable tomatoes usually have indeterminate growth and are made in rows 70 cm apart (50 cm along the row between one plant and the other), it is convenient <strong>to arrange the supports horizontally</strong> (make two rows in pairs, the supports cross at the top , where they are tied, in this way the support gains stability and a part never undergoes trauma to the roots. Plants with a determined habit are transplanted in rows 120 cm apart and 70 cm on the row, the distance is greater because they have a horizontal development.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Piantare_le_piantine">Plant the seedlings</span></b>
<p><strong>Tomato transplantation.</strong>From sowing in seedbeds it is then passed into pots, up to the pre-flowering stage. At this point you can transplant, as long as the minimum temperatures are at least 10 degrees. The flowers need at least 13 degrees to attach, otherwise there is a fruitless drop. The transplant in the pre-flowering phase, when the plants are about 30 cm high, allows you to arrange the seedlings with the flowers facing the outside of the flower bed, so all the flowers will emerge from that side and harvesting will be very convenient.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Coltivare_il_pomodoro">Grow the tomato</span></b>
<p>To successfully cultivate tomato plants in the vegetable garden you need to have some precautions: arrange the right supports, keep weeds at bay, do not lack water with irrigation as needed and properly prune the plants by removing the tomato and trimming it. right height.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Costruire_i_sostegni_e_legare_il_pomodoro">Build the supports and tie the tomato</span></b>
<p>To prevent the tomato plant from lying down as it grows, or worse, breaking under the weight of the fruit, it is very important to arrange supports. The possibilities are many and if we turn to different gardens we can discover many different DIY scaffolding.</p>
<p>For varieties with determined growth, a simple vertical pole driven into the ground is sufficient, but in many cases it is better to build more complex structures.</p>
<p>The important thing is to ensure that the plant stands upright and sunny in all its parts. In addition to making the stakes, remember to tie the tomato stem as it grows, which is often overlooked.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Potatura_e_sfemminellatura_del_pomodoro">Tomato pruning and flaking</span></b>
<p><strong>Pruning of axillary shoots.</strong>The tomato plant produces sprouts in the armpit of the various leaves, also called poop or female. These should be cut close to the base as soon as possible (with the leaves or even with the nail), because they disperse the energy of the plant. The same goes for suckers that grow at the base. Females or suckers of a certain size can be used to reproduce the plant by cutting, so later tomatoes will be obtained. The cut axillaries can be left at the foot of the plants so as not to impoverish the soil. If the soil has too much nitrogen, females can also be born from the clusters of flowers and from the veins of the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Topping.</strong> The tomato must be left to grow until September, finally the central shoot is topped, letting the plant concentrate on the height reached rather than lengthening further. Specified growth varieties do not need to be topped.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Quanto_irrigare_il_pomodoro">How much to water the tomato</span></b>
<p>It is not easy to give correct information on how much water a crop needs, certainly the tomato is a vegetable that has a fair amount of water.</p>
<p>For greenhouse cultivation, tomatoes need 1,400 liters per square meter, in the vegetable garden it naturally depends on the climate and the soil.</p>
<p>On average, 600 - 900 liters are enough, including those that fall like rain. To get an idea, you can consider one millimeter of rain = 1 liter of water per square meter. If it does not rain, it usually gets wet once / twice a week, abundantly but without letting it stagnate.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Rotazione_colturale">Crop rotation</span></b>
<p>The tomato is a vegetable that is well fertilized and generally leaves a residual fertility that can be exploited by less demanding plants. After the tomato, <a title="Leguminose" href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/ortaggi/famiglie/leguminose.html">leguminous plants</a> (such as broad beans, chickpeas, peas, beans) can be cultivated even without basic fertilization, or liliaceae (garlic or onion).</p>

<b><span id="EN_Avversita_del_pomodoro">Adversity of the tomato</span></b>
<p>The tomato plant can be prey to some insects and above all it is subject to various diseases and physiopathies, which is why organic farming requires careful cultivation practice that can prevent problems, as well as constant monitoring that allows timely interventions.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Malattie_del_pomodoro">Diseases of the tomato</span></b>
<p>If fungal diseases occur, it is good to remember that the plants must be burned or thrown in the garbage and must not be used for composting or left on the ground. In addition, the spores of diseases such as tomato blight or fusarium can remain in the soil and hit the garden again in the following years, which is why crop rotation is important. In organic horticulture, prevention is fundamental: if you create the conditions for a healthy vegetable garden, you can avoid resorting to treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Downy mildew.</strong>This disease is recognized by the yellowing of the leaves, looking against the light you can see different densities in the yellowed leaf. The color then changes to brownish and is transmitted in patches on the stem and fruit. On tomato fruits, downy mildew manifests itself in spots in concentric circles. It usually strikes from mid-August, due to nighttime humidity and temperatures. To combat it, Bordeaux mixture, copper oxychloride or in any case organic products based on copper are used, even if a good prevention can reduce the use of the fungicide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/malattie/alternaria-pomodoro.html"><strong>Alternaria</strong></a>. Another fungal disease that affects the tomato and like downy mildew begins with a yellowing of the leaves, and then manifests itself in dark spots and rot in the fruits. The rot can be found in any part of the fruit, thus it is distinguished from the apical rot, which is instead a physiopathy. The alternaria in organic farming always contrasts with copper treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Fusarium and verticillium.</strong> Tomato fusarium causes rapid death of plants, which dry out after wilting. Opening the stem, the black capillaries can be seen, a sign of the infection. The affected plant must be eliminated promptly, otherwise the disease spreads quickly throughout our tomato crop.</p>
<p><strong>Rhizottonia or pitium.</strong>Fungal disease that affects tomatoes, carrots and parsley, acts when there is high humidity and temperatures of at least 20 degrees, affects the plant at the collar and roots. To avoid it, it is advisable to disinfect the sowing soil and the soil of the vegetable garden with copper.</p>
<p><strong>Bacteriosis.</strong>When the tomato is affected by bacteria, small dots appear on the leaves and a growth arrest, copper can cure this problem, not being irreversible like the fungal diseases.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Fisiopatie_del_pomodoro">Physiopathies of the tomato</span></b>
<p>Unlike diseases, physiopathies are problems due to abnormal environmental conditions, restoring the correct situation can save the plant. We see the main symptoms that something in the climate or in the ground is not going right.</p>
<p><strong>Apical rot.</strong>It manifests itself as a black spot on the fruit, it mainly affects the elongated varieties and is jokingly called the “black ass of the tomato”. Apex rot is generally due to a lack of water, it can also be due to too much nitrogen or potassium in the soil. It is one of the most common physiopathies, you can learn more by reading the article dedicated to apical rot.</p>
<p><strong>Tomato canning.</strong>It happens that the fruit is soft and withered because the development of the placenta stops. This phenomenon is called boxing and is due to a sudden shortage of water.</p>
<p><strong>Not staining.</strong>.With temperatures above 35 degrees, the production of lycopene stops, so the tomato does not take on color. Fruit canning often occurs at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Drop some flowers.</strong> The flowers dry out and fall off without producing fruit. Generally it occurs for climatic reasons (too cold, too hot), but it also happens for states of suffering of the plant or lack of pollination of the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>Splitting of the fruit.</strong> The tomato thickens the skin in case of drought, subsequent heavy rains can split the fruits.</p>
<p><strong>Cracks.</strong> They are due to high humidity in the air and generally occur from the second half of August. They manifest themselves as a spider web that affects only the upper part, while the lower one remains healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Sunburn.</strong>The strong sun can make the tomato fruit whitish or brownish, in the days of strong summer sun it is advisable to resort to shading nets to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Muzzle of cat.</strong>Three dry spots that appear on the fruit at the apex are so called, due to the lack of production of auxins. It occurs if too many leaves are removed from the plant, beware of vigorous pruning.</p>

<b><span id="EN_Insetti_e_parassiti_del_pomodoro">Insects and parasites of the tomato</span></b>
<p>From bedbugs to aphids we discover together who are the enemies of the garden that we can find on tomatoes and how to fight them without the use of toxic insecticides, but remaining in biological methods.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Aphids.</strong>These tomato lice are dangerous above all because they transmit virosis to plants, they can be recognized at first sight when they curl up the leaves. In the organic garden you can fight aphids with<a title="Il piretro: un insetticida naturale" href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/insetticidi/piretro.html">pyrethrum</a> (organic insecticide) or with natural methods, such as garlic, nettle macerate or Marseille soap. The biological defense against aphids is mainly done by ladybugs, tireless predators of these lice.</li>
    <li><strong>Elaterids.</strong>These are underground worms that attack the roots, their attack is noted by observing the unexplained decay of the plants. On Orto Da Coltivare you can learn more about<a title="Elateridi o ferretti" href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/insetti/elateridi.html">how to defend yourself from elateridae</a>with a biological way.</li>
    <li><strong>Night.</strong>The larvae of these moths come out of the ground at night time and eat the aerial part of the plants, they can fight with the bacillus thuringensis, to learn more you can read the <a title="Agrotidi e nottue: larve di lepidotteri" href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/insetti/nottue.html">defense against the nocturnes</a>.</li>

<b><span id="EN_Le_varieta_di_pomodoro">The tomato varieties</span></b>
<p>The tomato is a vegetable for which many varieties have been selected, the shapes of the fruit can be different (for example, pear-shaped, elongated, round, cherry) and the color of the skin (from yellow to red, with streaks of black or green ), but above all we distinguish the different varieties of tomatoes based on the type of growth of the plant. We therefore have tomatoes with<strong>determined growth</strong>(stops growing) or <strong>indeterminate </strong>(continues to grow and therefore must be topped).</p>
<p>Generally, the plants with a determined development are tomatoes destined for industry, while those for fresh consumption and therefore from the vegetable garden have indeterminate growth, also because they have gradual ripening and are therefore better to cover the consumption needs of the family garden, in which the goal is to bring fresh vegetables to the table.</p>
<p>There are many famous tomato varieties, generally the sauce ones are distinguished from the table ones, from cherry tomatoes to pachino. Good qualities of table tomatoes are for example marmande, ox heart and carmelo.</p>
<p>To help you choose which tomato varieties to sow in your garden, I wrote an article describing some interesting and recommended<a href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/verdure/varieta/varieta-di-pomodoro.html">tomato varieties</a>. If you don't know what kind of tomato to plant you can take a look.</p>
<p>Preserving tomato seeds from one year to the next might be a good idea: it allows you to preserve a variety and avoid having to buy tomatoes every season. The important thing is to start with non-hybrid tomatoes, more details can be found in the article on <a href="https://www.ortodacoltivare.it/coltivare/semina/conserva-seme-pomodoro.html"> how to store tomato seeds</a>.</p>
